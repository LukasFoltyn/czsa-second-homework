    "You are allowed to collaborate and to use information from slides, books, internet etc., for solving this homework. HOWEVER, in the final exam, there will be some questions that are very similar to some questions of this homework and/or the previous homework. These questions can give ten (10) points in total on the exam. Therefore, it is beneficial for you to understand the answers you provide here.\n",

    "On the e-learning portal, next to this HW, you can find the input, $u[n]$ and output $y[n]$ of two signals generated according to this process. They are generated with the same filter but with different $u[n]$ and $e[n]$. They have the subscript ```train``` and ```test``` respectively. The input/output with subscript ```train``` should be used for estimating the filter parameters and the the input/output with subscript ```test``` should be used for evaluating it. This signals were originally of length 1100 but the first 100 samples have been discarded to reduce *settling in* effects.\n",

For this you can use the code from Exercise 11, e.g., the function ```make_mat_2``` and related calculations. Define the error, $e$, of the estimated filter as \n",

    "You can assume $N=M$( i.e., this is the order of the numerator and denominator is the same and this is the order of the filter) and test it e.g, for values $0,\\ldots,5$.\n",

    "- What is the best value of the $e_{\\rm{test}}$?\n",

    "Compare the power spectral density (PSD) of the output with the estimated PSD based on the input, your estimation of the noise and your estimation of the parameters for the filter. In other words, check numerically that the left side and right side of the above equation are similar. You can do this by computing the frequency response for left and right side, plot them and comfirm that the plots look similar.\n",

    "**Hints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recall that the power spectral density is obtained as $\\mathbb{E}\\frac{1}{N}|X[k]|^2= \\mathbb{E}\\frac{1}{N}X[k]\\overline{X[k]}$, so for the output $y[n]$, you can divide it into e.g, 10 chunks, calculate DFT for each of them, take the absolute value, then the square, then average over the chunks.\n",
    "- The frequency response of $\\frac{\\sum_{k=0}^N a_k z^{-k}}{1-\\sum_{k=1}^M b_k z^{-k}}$ and $\\frac{1}{1-\\sum_{k=1}^M b_k z^{-k}}$ can be obtained with the ```scipy.signal.freqz``` function or other methods shown in exercise 4. But be careful for which frequencies this function returns the frequencys response (check the documentation)\n",
    "- For the right hand side, you need to calculate the frequency response of the whole expression, then compute PSD.\n",
    "- The frequency response for uncorrelated (white) noise with variance 1 is 1 for all frequencies. (You may want to understand why but this is not part of the homework.)\n",

    "The definition of DTFT:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\widehat{g[n]}(\\omega)= \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}g[n]e^{-j\\omega nT_s }$$\n",

    "$$\\widehat{g[n-k]}(\\omega)= \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}g[n-k]e^{-j\\omega nT_s }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can substitue $n' = n - k$ and therefore $n = n' + k$. The euqation can be rewritten as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\widehat{g[n-k]}(\\omega)= \\sum_{n'=-\\infty}^{\\infty}g[n']e^{-j\\omega (n'+ k)T_s } = \\sum_{n'=-\\infty}^{\\infty}g[n']e^{-j\\omega n'T_s } e^{-j\\omega kT_s }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The term $e^{-j\\omega kT_s}$ does not depend on $n'$ therefore it can be factored out:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{n'=-\\infty}^{\\infty}g[n']e^{-j\\omega n'T_s } e^{-j\\omega kT_s } = e^{-j\\omega kT_s } \\sum_{n'=-\\infty}^{\\infty}g[n']e^{-j\\omega n'T_s }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The conclusion is that calculating DTFT of a shifted signal is exactly the same as calculating DTFT\n",
    "of a non shifted signal and subtracting $wkT_s$ from its phase.\n",

    "### Convolution in time, multiplication in frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of convolution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(f*g)[n]=\\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty}f[k]g[n-k]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When the DTFT is applied on the result of a convolution we get following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\widehat{(f*g)[n]}(\\omega)=\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}(\\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty}f[k]g[n-k]) e^{-j\\omega nT_s}$$\n",
